            I felt<br>

            the<br>
            weight.<br>
            frightened me<br>
            The fear is gone now<br>
            something else has taken its place:<br>

            <h4>What did you have for breakfast?</h4>
            <p>Two hard boiled eggs, a clementine from the farm next to my parents’ house, and black coffee.</p>
            <h4>What is your favorite pastime?</h4>
            <p>Walking, particularly in New York. It’s the best way to get to know a city and a surefire means by which to calm down the nervous system. I’ll happily inconvenience myself in the name of walking to my destination (as opposed taking the subway); no terrain is too impractical, no distance too extreme. I like to people-watch and walk simultaneously. The urbanist Jane Jacobs was famously a champion of the “sidewalk ballet,” the glorious social theater that plays out every day on our city’s streets. During my long walks I feel that I am equal parts observer and participant in the sidewalk ballet.</p>
            <h4>How do you think your frame of reference affects your art?</h4>
            <p>My frame of reference is shaped markedly by art history, as a student of the discipline and someone generally interested in layers of reference. Actually, it’s really difficult for me to extract my work from a broader artistic context, since it’s sort of what I’m trained to do. This can be really useful in some instances, and it undoubtedly makes me feel connected the lineage of artists who preceded me. Also, reference to art history, whether we like it or not, often functions to legitimize art; you could argue that a rooting in precedent confers upon artwork authority. On the other hand, in a culture that privileges originality I sometimes feel tethered to my points of reference in a limiting manner. I often wish I could look with the eyes of a child, not yet learned in the vocabulary of reference.</p>
