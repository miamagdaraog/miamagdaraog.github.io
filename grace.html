            <h3>Grace</h3>
            <h4>20, needham—massachusetts</h4>
            <p>It is dark<br>
            and the lights are wet;<br>
            I am above them<br>
            I feel the security of solitude,<br>
            So long as I can see the lights<br>
            It is a little over an hour now<br>
            so much time used up<br>
            when Time stopped—and Distance too.<br>
            —and the question had frightened me.<br>
            We are flying west with the night<br>
            It is the last light, standing on the last land.<br>
            The fear is gone now—

            <p>Reading in bed with hot coffee.</p>
            <h4>How do you think your frame of reference affects your art?</h4>
            <p>Loaded question. I am very interested in how people see themselves and how they, see the world, as a psychologist. This affects my art because I am showing how I see myself and the world around me through how I think people see themselves and the world around them.</p>
