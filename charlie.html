            <h3>Charlie</h3>
            <h4>21, san diego—california</h4>
            <p>drenched<br>
            and<br>
            sobbing<br>
            I feel the security of solitude<br>
            and imagine the people care<br>
            in other hands<br>
            distance and time<br>
            Time and Distance too.<br>
            blue-and-silver the photographers<br>
            their cameras, in sullen rebellion,<br>
            the dogmatic argument of blueprints that said<br>
             she <i>had</i> to fly because the figures proved it.<br>
            So she had flown, once airborne,<br>
            lifted the weight<br>
            question<br>
            two thousand miles of unbroken ocean<br>
            the night<br>
            We are with the night<br>
            the last light,<br>
            the last<br>
            flashes—so many to the minute.<br>
            I fly out to sea.<br>
            gone<br>
            the confidence and the trust,<br>
            the inherent belief in security

            <p>Hiking.</p>
            <h4>How do you think your frame of reference affects your art?</h4>
            <p>I think everything about my life—my personal/familial history, my perception/thought process—affects my art. Without my experience and the told experience of those around me, I wouldn’t have become the person I am today. Thus, my art is a reflection of anything/everything I (subconsciously and consciously) deem important.</p>
