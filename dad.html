            <h3>Juan</h3>
            <h4>49, san diego—california</h4>
            <p>It is dark and I am<br>
            the lights<br>
            the lights are rain, and I am dry.<br>
            I am sobbing but<br>
            I feel the solitude of escape.<br>
            I can imagine people<br>
            selfishly triumphant, as if I have<br>
            the small sorrow<br>
            I left the Irish Sea behind me<br>
            distance and time are the same.<br>
            Time stopped—and Distance too.<br>
            It was the moment I lifted<br>
            their cameras, the moment I felt<br>
            the earth in sullen rebellion,<br>
            the persuasion of argument that said<br>
            she had yielded to the question<br>
            We are unbroken<br>
            We are standing<br>
            counting the minute pass<br>
            gone now<br>
            is confidence and trust

            <p>Music and coffee (sometimes together!).</p>
            <h4>How do you think your frame of reference affects your art?</h4>
            <p>Not an artist per se, but I imagine our lived experience and knowledge informs our mindset (frame of reference) which influences anything we do.</p>
