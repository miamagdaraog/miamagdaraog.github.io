                and I<br>
                roars in solitude,<br>
                So long as I have<br>
                care behind me<br>
                the persuasion of<br>
                blueprints<br>
                proved once airborne<br>
                are bound for unbroken ocean.<br>
                So there ahead of me is<br>
                the last<br>
                minute.<br>
                The fear is gone now<br>
                because something else has taken its place;

            <p>Collaging and making oil pastel drawings of my friends and playing music (pastimes plural).</p>
            <h4>How do you think your frame of reference affects your art?</h4>
            <p>Growing up, I was lucky enough to be surrounded by creativity. I learned how it could be a part of everyday life, not a mere hobby. My mom always taught me to see the silver lining in things and I think it's very reflective in my art—a manifestation of seeing beauty in the darkest corners of life! Further, I am constantly inspired by the small and supposedly mundane vignettes around us and much of my art acts as a pedestal for these interactions.</p>
