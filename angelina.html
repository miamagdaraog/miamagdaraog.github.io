            <h4>20, oakland—california</h4>
            <p>It is dark already I am over<br>
            the lights are wet,<br>
            I am above them<br>
            in a sobbing world,<br>
            I imagine the people<br>
            walking under<br>
            I left<br>
            behind me like so much time used up.<br>
            time are the same. Time stopped—and Distance too.<br>
            the moment the photographers aimed their cameras,<br>
            she <i>had</i> to fly<br>
            Now, where are we bound?<br>
            —and the question had frightened me.<br>
            We are bound for a place thirty-six hundred miles from here—<br>
            So there behind me is<br>
            and ahead of me is<br>
            It is the last light,<br>
            Then I fly out to sea.<br>
            The fear is gone now—<br>
            something else has taken its place

            <h4>How do you think your frame of reference affects your art?</h4>
            <p>Everything is art to me (cliche I know), but I find inspiration in anything—cup of coffee, making eye contact with a stranger, interacting with friends, etc. I think once you stop looking for art and realizing it’s actually perpetually all around you is when it rlly starts to flow.</p>
