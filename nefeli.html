            <p>It is dark over Ireland.<br>
            the lights are wet; they are drenched in Irish rain,<br>
            but it imparts no sadness to me.<br>
            even the small sorrow of rain in other hands. <br>
            it is a little England, Wales, used up<br>
            It was the aimed<br>
            its burden and only to listen<br>
            of stick and elevators,<br>
            So she had flown, once she<br>
            —and two thousand miles of it unbroken ocean<br>
            and ahead of me is Berehaven Lighthouse<br>
            I the minute<br>
            something else has taken its place;

            <h4>How do you think your frame of reference affects your art?</h4>
            <p>I feel like I have a lot to add to my art because of the things that I’ve experienced. I feel I have a more well-versed view on life because I grew up moving around and living in different parts of the world. Which forced me to experience new cultures and norms.</p>
